# Coursera: Principles of Computing Parts 1 and 2

This is the code I produced while following the Principles of Computing courses by Rice University on Coursera.

The assignments were mainly focused on implementing simple game logic using basic features of Python.

There are GUIs available for the games, but I don't have access to the modules, so I am only left with the logic behind each game. However enough of the logic is present that you could probably get the games to work by implementing simple GUIs.

These are mainly to show some simple programming elements that I've used.
